        "---\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than actions and data rather than logic.\n",
        "  - In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which can be thought of as blueprints or templates for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "---\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behaviors that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "  - Essentially, a class provides a way to group related data and functions together, so that they can be managed in a modular way.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Key Components of a Class:*\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Attributes(Properties)*: These are variables that represent the state or data of an object. They are sometimes called fields or member variables. Every object created from the class can have different values for these attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Methods(Functions)*: These are functions that define the behavior of the objects. Methods usually operate on the object's attributes and can perform tasks like changing their values or providing output based on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Constructor*: A special method that is automatically called when a new object of the class is created. It initializes the object and sets up its attributes with initial values.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "---\n",
        "  - In **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, an **object** is an instance of a **class**. While a class is the blueprint or template, an object is the actual entity created based on that blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An object combines **data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods) into a single unit. It is the concrete manifestation of a class and can be thought of as an individual entity that can hold its own state and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points About Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Instance of a Class**: When you create an object, it is an instance of a particular class. A class defines the structure and behavior, and an object is a specific instantiation of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Attributes (State)**: The data that belongs to the object. These are the variables associated with the object, and each object can have its own distinct set of values for these attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Methods (Behavior)**: The functions that are associated with the object. These methods define the actions that an object can perform.\n",

        "\n",
        "Great question! **Abstraction** and **encapsulation** are two fundamental concepts in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and while they are related, they serve different purposes. Let's break down each one to see how they differ.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Abstraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstraction** is about **hiding the complexity** and showing only the essential features of an object or system. In other words, abstraction lets you focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it. It provides a simplified view by hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "* The goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity and allow a programmer to work with a higher-level view of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Hides **implementation details**.\n",
        "* Focuses on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.\n",
        "* Often implemented using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.\n",
        "* Allows the programmer to work with concepts without worrying about the specifics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Encapsulation** is about **bundling the data (attributes)** and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It also refers to restricting access to some of an object’s internal state or data and controlling how that data is accessed or modified. This is done using **private** or **protected** access modifiers.\n",
        "* Encapsulation helps to **protect** the object’s data from unauthorized access and modification. It makes sure that the object’s state remains consistent.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **`__len__(self)`**: Defines how `len()` works on an object (e.g., length of a list).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`__add__(self, other)`**: Customizes the behavior of the `+` operator for objects (like adding two objects).\n",
